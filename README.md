The repository utilizes machine learning methods to construct spatially continuous CO2 distributions. Code and data are being uploaded one after another. If you have any questions, please email zhangmq@mail.ustc.edu.cn. The relevant papers is
"Mapping contiguous XCO2 by machine learning and analyzing the spatio-temporal variation in China from 2003 to 2019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159588

There is too much code data used in the project. Although I have disclosed some code and data, the corresponding code copyright is still owned by me. After all, this work took me a long time, if you want to refer to the code and data, please contact me. Thanks for your understanding. Maybe you can learn some tricks from messy code.

The code that has been opened is enough for some novice researchers to learn, and it is unlikely that I will open all the code, because that is a person's precious labor and knowledge. Open part of the code is already leading. We hope those who used this code could understand this.
